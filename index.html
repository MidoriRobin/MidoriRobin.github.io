				<h2>Biography</h2>
				<p>I am a detail oriented college student Computer Science major, currently attending The University of the West Indies. During the course of my academic career, I also managed to accrue nearly six months of work experience. In both my academic and professional life, I have been consistently praised as adaptable by my professors and peers. Whether working on academic, extracurricular, or professional projects, I apply proven problem solving, teamwork and communication skills. Ive had a bit of a slow start, due to constantly worrying about what i want to do in life, but ive been seeing more and doing more. Right now I'm ready to put my energy into something big.</p>
